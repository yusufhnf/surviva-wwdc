 # Surviva! Introduction
 
 In protecting yourself, it is not enough just to wash your hands and maintain social distancing. But we must continue to carry out routine activities outside the home that require interacting with many people so that we must avoid Coronavirus, one of which is by increasing immunity. According to the doctor's opinion quoted by Alodokter.com, the body's reaction when infected with the Coronavirus is to form the body's resistance to eradicate the virus. If the immune system is strong, the virus will die. However, in people whose immune systems are weak, the Coronavirus can be difficult to fight, resulting in severe symptoms and fatal complications. In the Surviva game, players are required to maintain 3 important things to protect themselves from COVID-19 as Fun, Health, and Immunity. To maintain these 3 bars, players must take items such as healthy food to maintain the Health bar, sports items to keep the Immune bar, and hobby items to maintain the Fun bar. In addition, players must avoid items such as sick people, viruses, and interactions.
